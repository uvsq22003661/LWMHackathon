# LWM Hackathon
This project was created for the LWM Hackathon by JOLY Thomas, PIRABAKARAN Thanushan and SANTINI Maya from Universit√© Paris-Saclay.
## Help my project
**Help my project** was designed in order to help Computer Science researchers with their project, who already have a specific or large idea of what they want to work on. First, they will have to communicate their original idea with us.

Our program provided help on 3 different aspects of the research, and offers 3 options : 

- **Inform me** : 

    For researchers who would like to get in touch with professionnals who can help them with their subject. They may want to work with them on their new project, ask them questions or just build up their network of specialists. **Inform me** will return a list of jobs, and why it would be interesting to contact one : the first job that pops up will be the job that is most likely to help them.

- **Inspire me** : 

    3 possibilities will be available :
    - **Structure** : The program will come up with an approach to their subject.
    - **Ideas** : The program will suggest around 3 aspects to explore related to the project.

    Each of these services can then be used 5 more times within the same project, on the condition that more material and elements are provided each time.

- **Fund me** : 

    The researcher would like to find potential funding. **Fund me** will return a list of examples of investors, along with the fields they have invested in pertaining to the topic of the researcher's project. 
    First, it will give them a few names on each continent. The researcher will have the option of either focusing on one continent or one country.
        
All of our program is based on CHATGPT and the use of its API, with a Python script.


To execute our program, go to the terminal and type ```python3 HelpMyProject.py``` after downloading it.

## Vision

This program could be turned into a website and application which will provide our initial idea :
- Instead of focusing this on Computer Science researcher, extending it to all researchers.
- Giving names of potential collaborators on **Inform me** and not only jobs to reach out to.
- Adding a topic _Articles_ in **Inspire me** in order to give Articles related to the researcher's topic.
- Giving names of potential funders.
- Precising the accuracy by adding Chain-of-Thought prompting and more human feedback.
